This program solves the 8-Queens problem using backtracking.
You first enter where to place the first queen on the board.
Then the program tries to place the remaining queens row by row so that
no two queens attack each other (no same column or diagonal).
If a position is unsafe, it backtracks and tries another.
When all 8 queens are safely placed, the final 8×8 matrix is printed.


Viva --
It uses backtracking — first queen is placed by user,
then the program checks safe spots for others row by row.
If a position causes conflict, it backtracks.
Finally, all 8 queens are placed safely on the board.



OUTPUT -
After placing the first queen, the program tries to place the next queens row by row.
For each new row, it checks if a position is safe — meaning no other queen is in the same column or diagonal.
If a safe spot is found, the queen is placed there.
If not, the program backtracks (removes the last queen) and tries a different column.


The program starts with the first queen at (1,1),
then places all remaining queens safely using backtracking,
and prints a final 8×8 matrix where each 1 marks a queen’s safe position.
