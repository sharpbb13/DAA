This program solves the Fractional Knapsack Problem using the Greedy Method.
The aim is to fill a knapsack of limited capacity with items having different weights and values, such that the total value inside the knapsack is maximum.
Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack, we are allowed to take fractions of items.

1. Input Section
- The user enters the number of items.
- For each item, the program takes weight and value together on the same line.
- Finally, the user enters the capacity of the knapsack.

2. Sorting by Value-to-Weight Ratio -
items = sorted(zip(weights, values), key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)
- Each item’s value/weight ratio is calculated.
- The items are sorted in descending order of this ratio.
- This step represents the greedy choice — always pick the most valuable item per unit weight first.

3. Filling the Knapsack
- The program iterates over the sorted items.
- If an item can fit completely in the remaining capacity, it is taken fully.
- If it cannot fit completely, the program takes only the fraction that fits and stops (since the bag is now full).
- The total value is accumulated in res.

Output Section
The program displays which items (or fractions) were taken and shows the maximum total value achievable with the given capacity.

Complexities :
Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
Space Complexity: O(1)


VIVA - 
this program solves the Fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
It calculates each item’s value-to-weight ratio, sorts items by this ratio, and then keeps adding the highest-ratio items until the bag is full.
If an item doesn’t fit completely, only a fraction is taken.
This gives the maximum total value possible.
The time complexity is O(n log n).




OUTPUT - 
How it works:

1. Calculate value/weight ratio for each item:
- Item 1 → 60/10 = 6
- Item 2 → 100/20 = 5
2. Sort items by ratio (highest first): Item 1 → Item 2
3. Start filling the knapsack:
- Take Item 1 fully (weight 10 fits perfectly).
Remaining capacity = 15 - 10 = 5
- Take 5 weight units of Item 2 (since only 5 capacity is left).
Fractional value = 5 × (100/20) = 25
